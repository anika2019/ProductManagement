# ProductManagement
LMS for rural 12 school

I am developing a Learning Management System for a K12 rural school. It is intended towards institute of product leadership capstone project. I will be going though all the phases of a product development (from problem definition to ideation and prototyping to launch stage).

Whole project will go through 5 phases, In phase-1: i will define the problem space by interacting with users and their day to day problems faced in academic year.
In phase-2: I will be covering product design phase, based on the insight obtained from user problem, i will create high fidelity prototypes. In phase-3: I will use agile methodology to keep track of product development (by aligning all the stakeholders). In phase-4: I will be using concepts from Go-to-market strategy and gain insight from market (customers) as how do they see this project and whether they like this concept or not? In phase-: I will apply product analytics to know if i have succeded in my efforts and whether product can satisfy our business goals?
